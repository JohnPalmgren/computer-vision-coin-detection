# Computer Vision Coin Detection

## About

The aim is to detect coins in the image, work out their total and individual value and display the results in the image.

This project started from the Capstone project for the Udemy Complete Python Programmer Bootcamp 2020. That involved using OpenCV to detect circular coins in an image. I expanded that to include the 50p coin that couldn’t be detected using OpenCV’s circle detection.

## Technologies used

- Python 3.8
- OpenCV 4.2.0
